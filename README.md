#Latin Lookup
Quickly define a Latin word using the Glosbe API.

## Why?

I was annoyed with the time-wasting process of seeing a unfamiliar word when reading Latin texts online, opening a new tab, searching wikitionary for it, and then scrolling down to the Latin section just to get a one word definition.

This addon uses the [Glosbe API](https://glosbe.com/) which has documentation found [here](https://glosbe.com/a-api). Wikitionary, which has a huge amount of info on Latin words including full charts for declension/conjugation, does not
have an API. The Glosbe API only gives me the English translation so I can't show any extra info such as gender, part of speech, etc.
